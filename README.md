## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position. 

# Acceptance Criteria

- Sample of previous work.
- When profile is loaded the following should be present:
1. Developer's name
2. Recent photo or avatar
3. Links to sections about developer, developer's work and contact information

- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- When the section about developer's work is clicked then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
- When presented with the developer's first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
- When the images of the applications are clicked then viewer is taken to that deployed application.
- When the page is resized or site viewed on various screens and devices then viewer is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
